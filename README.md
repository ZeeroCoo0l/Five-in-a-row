# Five-in-a-Row
## About This Project
I created this Five-in-a-Row game as a school project to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence concepts, specifically the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This classic game (also known as Gomoku) provided the perfect playground for implementing and testing these concepts in a practical application.
## Technical Implementation
The project is built entirely in Java. I implemented the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to create an AI opponent that can make strategic decisions based on evaluating potential future board states. This approach allows the AI to "think ahead" by considering possible moves and countermoves to determine the optimal play.
The alpha-beta pruning optimization significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the decision tree compared to a standard minimax implementation, making the AI more efficient without sacrificing its playing strength.
## What I Learned
Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Implementing game tree search algorithms
- Understanding the minimax algorithm and its applications
- Applying alpha-beta pruning to optimize search performance
- Developing a functional board game with AI capabilities

This project served as a practical application of theoretical concepts learned in class, reinforcing my understanding of AI search algorithms through actual implementation.
Feel free to try out the game, examine the code to see how the minimax algorithm works in practice, or use it as a reference for your own projects involving game AI.
